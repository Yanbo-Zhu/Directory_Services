LDAP: Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
轻型目录访问协议


# 1 总览
了使得 directory 能够被 functionaise ,  it is necessary to have a protocol in place for querying it, maintaining it, and authenticating access to it. 这个 protocol 就是 LDAP 
LDAP is a protocol that many different directory services and access management solutions can understand.

|是什么|- LDAP 只是一种协议， 他规定了一些流程，  many different directory services and access management solutions can understand LDAP<br>- 符合 LDAP的定义的 funtion 叫做 LDAP Funktion<br>- LDAP 不是一个实体， 不是什么produkt. 就跟 说网络报文通过ip协议发送到xx 一样 <br><br>- LDAP is a lightweight client-server protocol used to access directory services..<br>- LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an open and cross platform protocol used for directory services authentication.<br>-  in other way we can say like that it is an open cross the platform used for directory, services, authentication<br>-  open and cross-platform application protocol used over an IP network to manage and access directory information|
|usage|- It is used to access and manage the directory information<br>- LDAP also enables permission for users to access resources like printers that share the same network. <br>- LDAP can create Singl-single Policy for every persion|
|使用|- LDAP provides the communication language that applications use to communicate with other directory services servers.<br>- Directory access is performed via LDAP—whenever a client performs a search for a specific object in AD (say for a user or a printer), LDAP is being utilized to query relevant objects and return the correct results.|

## 1.1 LDAP 端口

Longer answer:

LDAPS uses its own distinct network port to connect clients and servers.
- The default port for LDAP is port 389,
- but LDAPS uses port 636 and establishes TLS/SSL upon connecting with a client.

## 1.2 Secure LDAP/ LDAPS

While LDAP encryption isn't standard, there is a nonstandard version of LDAP called Secure LDAP, also known as "LDAPS" or "LDAP over SSL" (SSL, or Secure Socket Layer, being the now-deprecated ancestor of Transport Layer Security).

## 1.3 Domain controller 

Set Security police in Domain controller 
使得  user Group 有不同的 Security police（不同的 Security police 有 不同的权限）

# 2 其他 符合 LDAP 的  directory service product 

Red Hat Directory Service
OpenLDAP
Apache Directory Server, 

Occasionally you’ll hear someone say, “We don’t have Active Directory, but we have LDAP.” What they probably mean is that they have another product, such as OpenLDAP, which is an LDAP server.

LDAP仅仅是一个访问协议，那么我们的数据存储在 支持 通过LDAP协议访问的 server上
